    compatibility;
```

#### **Mobile-Responsive Design**

```css
Breakpoint Strategy:
- sm: 640px (small tablets)
- md: 768px (tablets)
- lg: 1024px (desktops)
- xl: 1280px (large screens)
```

#### **German Localization**

- Local terminology and phrases
- European design patterns
```

### Visual Design System

#### **Color Palette**

```css
Primary Colors:

- Neutral Grays: Text and backgrounds
```

#### **Typography**

- Clear hierarchy (h1-h6, body text)
```

#### **Component Patterns**

```typescript
Consistent Elements:
- Card-based layouts with shadows
- Gradient backgrounds for visual depth
- Hover effects with smooth transitions
- Loading states and error handling
```

## 📊 Data Flow & Architecture

### Database Schema Overview

```sql
Core Tables:
- events: Village events and meetings
- news: News articles and announcements
- contacts: Community contact directory
- portraits: Community member submissions
- gallery_images: Photo gallery content
```

### Caching Strategy

```typescript
Layers:
1. Next.js Static Generation (build time)
2. unstable_cache with tags (runtime)
3. Browser caching (client side)
4. CDN caching (Vercel Edge)

Cache Tags:
- 'events': All event-related data
- 'news': News articles and content
- 'contacts': Contact directory
- 'portraits': Community submissions
```

### API Structure

```typescript
RESTful Endpoints:
- GET /api/events - Fetch events
- POST /api/admin/events - Create event
- PUT /api/admin/events/[id] - Update event
- DELETE /api/admin/events/[id] - Delete event
- Similar patterns for news, portraits, gallery
```
